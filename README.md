# Multiplayer Session-Based Game Hosting on AWS

This repository contains the implementation and setup guide for a multiplayer session-based game hosting solution using AWS services like GameLift, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

## Architecture Overview


![Screenshot 2024-09-10 141307](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21e92aae-0d37-47f7-852a-ad53d8888c72)


The architecture leverages the following AWS services:

1. **Amazon Cognito** - For managing user identities and authentication.
2. **Amazon API Gateway** - Serves as the entry point for game clients to interact with backend logic.
3. **AWS Lambda** - Handles the backend logic, including player data updates and matchmaking ticket processing.
4. **Amazon DynamoDB** - Stores player data and matchmaking tickets.
5. **Amazon GameLift** - Manages multi-region fleets and session queuing for players.
6. **Amazon SNS** - Sends notifications when game sessions are ready.
7. **Amazon CloudWatch** - Monitors system performance, logs, and dashboards.

## Prerequisites

To deploy this solution, you'll need:

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials
- Node.js and serverless framework for deploying Lambda functions

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-multiplayer-game-hosting.git
cd aws-multiplayer-game-hosting

```
### Step 2: Deploy AWS Resources
Use AWS CloudFormation or the Serverless framework to deploy the Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB tables, and GameLift fleets.


### Step 3: Configure Amazon Cognito
Create a Cognito User Pool for player authentication.
Attach the Cognito User Pool to API Gateway to ensure secure API access.
### Step 4: Setting Up Amazon GameLift
Create GameLift fleets in multiple regions.
Set up game session queues and matchmakers.
### Step 5: Monitoring and Logging
Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring application performance and generating alerts based on predefined metrics.
### Step 6: Testing the Game
After deploying, you can test the system by running the game client and making API calls to initiate a game session.

## Key Features
#### Session Management: Seamless handling of multiplayer sessions through GameLift and API Gateway.
##### Scalability: Uses AWS GameLift fleets in multiple regions for high availability.
#### Real-Time Matchmaking: Efficient matchmaking using DynamoDB and Lambda functions.
#### User Authentication: Secure authentication using Amazon Cognito.
